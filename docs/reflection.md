# Reflection

The hardest part for me was having no experience with being the sole responsible person of a project at scale. This resulted in continuous uncertainty because of not knowing for myself when something was considered good or done. This occasionally caused me losing motivation in doing something.

I tend to break an idea apart into all its pieces and analyze those in my head, when all aspects make sense in real-world scenarios, it's considered good. It's a very functional first approach to a problem, building something from the ground up from things that make sense (works well for programming), opposed to experience first, in which you come up with a wild idea and then bring it back to reality.

But when coming up with ideas for a bigger project like this, with multiple stakeholders and users, vastly complex data sets, almost infinite possibilites due to open requirements, and responsibility for all the desciplines around design and development â€” functional first gets you nowhere. Every idea that came to mind had to make sense in the sea of variables that are the things I just mentioned, but you can't. You can't keep all those things in mind at every turn, you limit yourself.

I was struggeling to find a method, a structure, or something that aligned with the way I approach things. I only found this out rather late when I started researching storytelling, I found out that whatever you do, you are trying to convey a message or story; and there are proven ways of doing that. Those ways
helped me limit my fuctional first thinking to smaller, less monolithic, pieces.

The biggest lesson to be learned from this project is how I need to maneuver myself, the way I think, around a project without limiting myself whilst keeping me motivated in uncertain moments. Because creativity slumbers when motivation is lost.

### The first meeting (13 April 2018)

The main goal of the introductory meeting with The Things Network was to get a hold of TTN's philosophy, their problems, and aspirations for the product. Unfortunately I didn't prepare enough as I assumed the dialogue would come natural and the information I needed would follow, but that didn't exactly happen and it resulted in a lesser understanding of TTN. Luckily I wasn't the only one in the meeting and others jumped as well but I learned to _really_ prepare meetings and annotate during those meetings.
