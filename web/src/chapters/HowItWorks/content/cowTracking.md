#### Cow tracking

Equipped with a powerful microcontroller, our SODAQ Cattle Tracker is LoRaWAN based device. The board is using the ublox Eva 8m GPS module, giving it a GPS fix within seconds. It can stay in (deep) sleep mode until it moves. A LED light shows the status of the board through the waterproof casing of the tracker.
