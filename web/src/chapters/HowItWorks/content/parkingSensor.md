#### Parking sensor

PrestoSense detectors are installed on on-street parking bays. They not only detect a vehicle’s presence, but also the parking duration of a car. The information is forwarded to the parking operator. He uses the data to analyze the load and turnover rate of his car park and to optimize enforcement. The motorist uses the information directly on his smartphone. The city’s traffic guidance system or the motorist’s GPS system guide him to the next available parking bay.
